# whitefox
My keyboard configuration for the [Whitefox](https://input.club/whitefox) developed by [Input Club](https://input.club).

This is based on the [True Fox]() layout but slightly adapted to be closer to the standard [Vortex pok3r](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&c=165) layout.

![current config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markstgodard/whitefox/master/current.png)

The configuration is based on the generated [web configurator](https://input.club/configurator-whitefox/)

## Key modifications
* Modifier keys are standard Apple: ctrl, alt, cmd
* Kill capslock, replace with f1
* Layer 1: HJKL for standard vim movement
* Layer 1: enter map to backspace
* Switch true fox backspace with backslash/pipe
* Relocate backspace to top right
* move tilde beside backspace
* f1-f12
* AnyKey == backspace

## next
* media keys: volume, media, eject (putting Mac to sleep) and LED brightness.
* macros for tmux (ctrl-b is a pain)
