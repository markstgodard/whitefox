# whitefox
My keyboard configuration for the [Whitefox](https://input.club/whitefox) developed by [Input Club](https://input.club).

This is based on the [True Fox]() layout but slightly adapted to be closer to the standard [Vortex pok3r](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&c=165) layout.

The config is based on the generated [Configurator](https://input.club/configurator-whitefox/)
